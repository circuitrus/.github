Board-level and IC-level EDAs.

For board-level designs: simply process of wiring.

For IC-level designs: optimize netlists and logic.

I have no ideas yet about IC-level EDAs.

But I am learning implementations about HLS.
I hope we don't have to use RTL to write state machines even in CPU/GPU in the future! ðŸ˜‹
